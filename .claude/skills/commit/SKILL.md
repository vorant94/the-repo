1. Explore the changes that are staged for commit both that you did during the session and if there are any changes user added manually afterwards
2. Come up with a short and descriptive commit message including a general title and summary list of included changes
3. There may be changes that were made "along the way", that aren't necessarily directly related to initial task itself. Don't forget to mention them as well if there are any
4. Commit the changes
