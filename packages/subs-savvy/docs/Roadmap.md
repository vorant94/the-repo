# Roadmap

### Phase 1: Web-based mobile-friendly MVP

Starting with the web is motivated by my prior tech experience (most of my programming experience is a web front-end/full-stack roles) and a cheaper development cost (free hosting with any cloud provider free-tier and publishing a new app version at any given point of time vs having to pay 100$ yearly for iOS developer license and passing a review for each new app version).

As a temporary solution for using the app from multiple devices there should be import/export data functionality. Consider new subscriptions aren't added that often import/export should be enough for the beginning to use the app like it has cross-device sync.

### Phase 2: Cross-device sync with user-based cloud provider

After [Main values](./User Stories.md#main-value) of the app achieved we should move to [Additional Conveniences](./User Stories.md#additional-conveniences) starting by allowing the user to access his/her data from multiple devices.

### Phase 3: Separate client apps for desktop and mobile

Since the app itself is technically isn't very complex and the value it brings to the user is very focused in order to stand out from competitors the app should provide better user experience i.e. feel more native to user OS, look nicer and so on. In terms of user stories it means to implement [Additional conveniences](./User Stories.md#additional-conveniences) stories #2, #3 and #4
