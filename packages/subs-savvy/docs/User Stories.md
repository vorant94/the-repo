### Main value

1. As a **full-time employee with monthly salary**, upon receiving salary at the start of the month I want to **calculate how much money is left there** after all sorts of regular expenses that I'm already subscribed to would be billed during the upcoming month, so that I can **freely manage this netto money** without being afraid to end up in dept at the end of upcoming month.

2. As a **person buying a property, that requires regular predictable maintenance** (like a car with all sorts of insurances and technical inspections), after some time of having this property I want to **have a clear picture of how much does this property cost** across all types of expenses related to it, so that I can **decide whether my "investment" pays off or not** and cut it off if it's not.

### Additional conveniences

1. As a **person that actively uses both mobile and desktop devices**, I want to **be able to use my phone to quickly add new subscription** I just subscribed to in the middle of the day and **to be able to use my laptop to analyze my expenses** when I plan to do it at home in a mindful way, so that I can **get the best of two worlds**: quickly update the data with phone that is always with me, analyze the data later with a big screen of laptop.

2. As a **fan of desktop apps experience**, I want to **all apps I'm using on my phone/desktop to be deeply integrated into respective OS**, so that I can **use the app when I'm offline** (app data isn't changing too often by its nature) as well as I can **deeper integrate the app with OS** (open it via Spotlight/Alfred, get native notifications etc.)

3. As a **person with bunch of regular but manual payments**, I want to **set up reminders on some of them**, so that I can **rely on the app to remember them** and therefore have less "routine" info in my head

4. As a **subscriber for international services**, I want to **set up subscription price both in my local currency as well in service currency**, so that I can **use my local currency in all calculations, but the subscription info itself reflects the same numbers, that I saw on a service website**
