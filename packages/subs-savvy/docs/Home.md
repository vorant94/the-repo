Welcome to the Subs-Savvy wiki!

### Motivation

Subs-Savvy is a finance-management app, that focuses solely on the optimization and transparency of user's regular payments. Common e-wallet apps usually go in one of two ways:

- either they force the user to put in each every transaction they make to calculate stuff, which is a tedious task that can easily overweight the usefulness of the app
- or they rely on connecting the bank account to fetch transactions from there in the background, which introduces too much automation and can nullify user's purposeful involvement

I noticed that when I want to optimize my budget it is easy to cut some irregular spendings, for example, just to temporary avoid visiting restaurants or buying new clothes. But the hard part - is to calculate how much is left from the salary after all the loans/taxes/insurances/subscriptions are paid behind the scene. How much is my real net income on a monthly basis? This is the reason I decided to build this app.
