- async gameplay
  - different factions
  - different races
    - lack of immersion on race theme
      - great hunt for taurens
  - different classes
    - lack of immersion on class basis
      - why should tauren druid fight night elf druid if we are all children of cenarius etc.?
      - why the heck warlocks are even allowed in both factions anyway?
- fixed points in time
  - first 6-slot bag drop in starting village
  - entering your faction capital for the first time
  - getting your first gold
  - starting to fill in "advanced" armor slots (shoulders, rings, helmet, etc.)
  - saving up money and buying a first mount at lvl 40
- multiplayer
  - grouping up with others during single player activities (quests)
  - being forced to group up for group-only activities (dungeons, quests)
- addons
  - not all 3-party solutions should be integrated into base game
    - having a built-in quest helper from the get go alters the content of the quests themselves
  - business model for 3-rd party tools shouldn't be direct payment or tons of ads
    - publishers should financially and technically support such tools
- questing
  - quest topics flowing from one zone to another
    - the great hunt (abandoned, replaced with just hunting)
    - hunting (barrens, ashenvale)
    - venture co (both as protecting environment in mulgore and stonetalon mountains and as goblin corporate war)
    - fighting local wildlife (mulgore, barrens, stonetalone mountains (?), ashenvale)
    - alliance horde war (barrens-ish, stonetalon mountains, ashenvale)
    - grimtotem taurens (stonetalon mountains, thousand needles)
    - burning blade (durotar, barrens, ashenvale (abandoned while ashenvale does have a lot of demons))
    - twilight's hammer (ashenvale)
    - numerous themes across dungeons
  - quests that send you exploring across the world (venture co of stonetalon mountains)
  - tedious runbacks and bulking quests as a solution to it but loosing quests context as a tradeoff
  - existing quest types
    - timer quests
    - kill N amount of creatures, including
      - kill 1 boss
      - kill 1 wandering rare mob (optionally elite)
    - bring N amount of items, including (optionally elite)
      - bring 1 trophy from a boss (optionally elite)
      - bring 1 trophy from wandering rare mob (optionally elite)
    - escort (barrens, stonetalon mountains, ashenvale)
    - defence (barrens, stonetalon mountains, ashenvale x2, thousand needles)
    - mailman
      - transfer to next zone to level up
      - quests that are picked up from items
  - class quests
  - profession quests
  - lacking quest types
    - unlocking game mechanics
- "redundant" systems
  - xp-based progression (level + class skills) vs action-based progression (professions)
    - get rid off two different systems and progress class skills based on character activity (so no balance is advanced if player uses feral build)
  - class trainers vs self-taught skills
  - soulbounded items are just dumb
    - makes you avoid spending gold on a gear while leveling
    - forces you to farm dungeons / raids for BiS gear instead of relying on AH
- achievements
  - when you give me a list it actually limits me as a player to this list. like is it all there is to it?
  - its cool to see your "statistics" (like in minecraft there is a lack of track of discovered biomes), but it shouldn't be something goal defining
- gold/silver/cooper vs just gold
  - embrace "redundant" systems instead of removing them
    - more class quests if buying skills from trainer is boring
